I started learning to build apps using Swift in 2015 as a hobby alongside school work. Since then I have worked on many hobby projects that I have released on the App Store.

After finishing studying, I worked at a startup for nearly four years.

In 2022, I quit my job and became a full-time indie developer. I now spend most of my days building these previous hobby projects alongside a small amount of contract work!</p><p>If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to <a href="/contact" target="_blank">Contact Me</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Experience</h2><div class="about-minor-section"><h3>Indie Work</h3><h4>iOS Developer, January 2016 - Present</h4><p>I started creating apps as a hobby after teaching myself iOS development using Swift. I have had experience developing for the majority of Apple’s platforms using UIKit, AppKit and, have more recently switched to using SwiftUI. The apps I build are quick to adopt new Apple APIs, such as Widgets and Siri Shortcuts.</p><p>After working in a start-up environment full-time since 2018, I decided to quit my job and become an indie developer full-time in 2022.</p></div><div><h3>Redbox Mobile</h3><h4>Application Developer, June 2018 - February 2022</h4><p>At Redbox Mobile, I was the sole iOS developer responsible for working on the ASO Toolkit app for iOS and macOS. This app was built entirely in SwiftUI and can be found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1455829852" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Whilst working here, I had the experience of working with a number of globally recognised brands to improve their app’s ASO and helped to manage their Apple Search Ads campaigns. I became one of the first in Europe to achieve a certification in Apple Search Ads from Apple too.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamfootdev" target="_blank">X</a> | <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@adamfoot">Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamfoot04/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/adamfootdev" target="_blank">GitHub</a> | <a href="mailto:support@adamfoot.dev" target="_blank">Email</a></p><p>© Adam Foot | Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
